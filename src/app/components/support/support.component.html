                                        easy resolution. You no longer have to go through the maze of an IVRS call
                                        support. Just search for your issue in the help section on this page and
                                        initiate a chat with us. A customer care executive will be assigned to you

                                        I entered the wrong CVV, why did my transaction still go through?

                                <p class="faq-text">The logic of validations of CVV resides with either payment gateways
                                        or banks. It is absolutely the choice of banks to have CVV as a mandatory input
                                        field or not. As per RBI guidelines, 2-Factor-Authentication is not mandatory
                                        for less than Rs 2000 rupees transaction. It is not in control of Swiggy. As an
                                        organization, we don't store any card information.</p>
